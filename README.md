# About this Repository

**cgorganelle** is a Rust library that works as a simple wrapper for the [Critter & Guitarri Organelle](https://www.critterandguitari.com/organelle) osc-based commands and was created primarily to allow other Rust projects to control the Organelle's hardware features such as the OLED display, LED, keys and potentiometers.

Please keep in mind that this library is still a work in progress.

Tested with Organelle-M running firmware 4.0
